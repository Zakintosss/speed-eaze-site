                <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Speed Eaze. This Privacy Policy explains how Axento ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information in relation to our automation services (the "Services"). This policy applies to anyone who interacts with our advertising technologies or visits a website or application where our Services are active.</p>
                <p>Our legal name is Axento and we can be contacted for any privacy-related questions by emailing us at admin@speedeaze.com.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy is designed to meet the requirements of major privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe and state-level privacy laws in the United States, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>2. The Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect information to provide and improve our advertising and automation services. The types of information we collect depend on how you interact with our technology.</p>
                
                <h3>A. Information You Do NOT Directly Provide to Us</h3>
                <p>Our Services are designed to operate without requiring individuals to directly provide us with personal information such as their name, email address, or phone number.</p>

                <h3>B. Payment Information</h3>
                <p>When a payment is required to use our services, we use a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to handle the transaction. We do not directly collect, store, or process your credit card details or financial account information. We receive a confirmation of payment from Stripe, which may include your billing name and a transaction identifier, but not your full financial details. We recommend you review Stripe's privacy policy to understand their practices.</p>

                <h3>C. Information We Automatically Collect</h3>
                <p>When you visit a website or application that uses our technology, or when you interact with an advertisement provided through our Services, we automatically collect certain information. This is the core of our data collection for advertising purposes. This information includes:</p>
                
                <h4>Identifiers:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Your unique address on the internet.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cookie IDs:</strong> A unique ID stored in a small file on your browser that allows us to recognize your browser over time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mobile Advertising IDs:</strong> Such as IDFA (for iOS) or AAID (for Android), if you interact with our services on a mobile application.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Device and Connection Information:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Browser Information:</strong> The type, version, and language settings of your browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari).</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> The type of device (e.g., Desktop, Mobile), operating system (e.g., Windows, iOS), and screen resolution.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Internet Activity and Usage:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Website Interaction:</strong> The pages you visit, the features you use, how long you stay on those pages, and what you click on.</li>
                    <li><strong>Referral Data:</strong> The web address of the site you came from before landing on a site using our Services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Search History:</strong> The search terms that may have led you to a site using our Services.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Advertising Interaction:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information about the ads you have been shown or have interacted with (e.g., clicked on).</li>
                    <li>The platform where you saw the ad (e.g., Google, Facebook).</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Geolocation Data:</h4>
                <p>We infer your general geographic location (e.g., country, state, and city) from your IP address. We do not collect precise GPS location.</p>

                <h4>Inferences:</h4>
                <p>We use the information listed above to draw inferences and create data segments. These are profiles about a user's potential preferences, interests, and characteristics (e.g., "User likely interested in marketing software," "User located in the United States"). We use these inferences to provide more relevant advertising on behalf of our clients.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>3. How and Why We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use the information we collect for several business and commercial purposes, which are strictly related to providing and operating our Services. These purposes include:</p>

                <h3>A. Providing and Operating Our Services</h3>
                <p>To deliver our core advertising automation services to our clients, including displaying advertisements on various platforms, managing ad campaigns, and ensuring ads are delivered correctly to the intended audiences.</p>

                <h3>B. Personalization and Targeted Advertising (Cross-Context Behavioral Advertising)</h3>
                <p>This is a primary purpose of our data processing. We use the information we collect, particularly Identifiers, Internet Activity, and Inferences, to show you ads that are more likely to be relevant to your interests. This involves tracking user activity across different, unaffiliated websites and applications over time, building profiles or "segments" based on your inferred interests, and frequency capping (to ensure you don't see the same ad too many times).</p>

                <h3>C. Analytics and Performance Measurement</h3>
                <p>To measure and analyze the effectiveness of the advertising campaigns run through our Services. This helps us and our clients understand which ads are being viewed and clicked on, measure conversion rates, and improve campaign performance.</p>

                <h3>D. Maintaining Security and Preventing Fraud</h3>
                <p>To protect the security and integrity of our Services, our clients, and the platforms where our ads are displayed. This includes using data like IP addresses to identify and prevent malicious activity, click fraud, and other security threats.</p>

                <h3>E. Legal Compliance and Enforcement</h3>
                <p>To comply with our legal obligations, regulations, or in response to lawful requests from public authorities (e.g., a court order or subpoena). We may also use this information to enforce our own terms of service and protect our rights and interests, or those of our users and third parties.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>4. How and With Whom We Share Your Information</h2>
                <p>We do not sell personal information in the traditional sense of the word. However, we do share information with third parties and service providers for the business purposes described in this policy, including for cross-context behavioral advertising. We may share the information we collect with the following categories of third parties:</p>

                <h3>A. Our Clients</h3>
                <p>We share information with our clients who use our Services to run their advertising campaigns. This information typically includes campaign performance reports and audience segments based on inferred interests.</p>

                <h3>B. Advertising, Analytics, and Technology Partners</h3>
                <p>We share data with third-party services that help us operate, analyze, and deliver our Services. These partners include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Advertising Platforms:</strong> Such as Google Ads, Meta (Facebook/Instagram) Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Microsoft Advertising.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytics Services:</strong> Such as Google Analytics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hosting & Cloud Providers:</strong> Such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Vercel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tag Management Systems:</strong> Such as Google Tag Manager.</li>
                    <li><strong>CRM & Marketing Platforms:</strong> Such as HubSpot, Mailchimp, and Salesforce.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>C. For Legal Obligations and Safety</h3>
                <p>We may disclose your information if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or legal process; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud or security issues; or to protect our rights or property.</p>

                <h3>D. In Case of Business Transfer</h3>
                <p>If Axento is involved in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction.</p>
